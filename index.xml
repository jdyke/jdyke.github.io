You can find the difference in 2 roles permissions, which permissions 2 roles share, list current permissions for a role, or find which role(s) have n + 1 permissions. All of this is done locally with no GCP permissions required.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/jdyke/gcp_iam_update_bot">GCP IAM monitor bot&lt;/a>: A bot that monitors and tweets when GCP updates their IAM roles.

Google does not provide an easy single pane of glass view into these types of metrics across thousands of projects so I created something to fill that gap.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/ScaleSec/gcp_api_key_inventory">GCP API key inventory&lt;/a>: Another custom python tool to inventory, analyze, and report on your GCP API keys in an automated fashion.&lt;/p>
