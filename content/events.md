- [SANS Institute CloudSecNext 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCQTeglIfeI&feature=youtu.be): CloudSecNext Summit & Training will bring together a unique combination of real-world user experiences and case studies, as well as practical, technical training focused on specific approaches and skills for building and maintaining a secure cloud infrastructure. As a virtual attendee, youâ€™ll explore current approaches, tools, and techniques with fellow practitioners facing similar cloud-related security challenges.

- [Cloud Security Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbqtZlooiJc): This was a podcast I was invited to about GCP cloud security. We talked about some of my open source projects, my path to CloudSec, fielded questions from viewers, and also my experiences in the industry. Awesome time!
