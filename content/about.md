{{< image src="/img/glasses.png" alt="its me" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

My name is Jason Dyke and I have over a decade of experience in Quality Insurance, IT, and AWS/GCP. I'm currently specializing in GCP security with key focus areas on IAM, infrastructure security, python automation (remediation, scripting, etc.), cryptography, and securing platform defaults. I love the daily challenges cloud security presents and the ability to be creative when solving complex problems is a huge driving force for me.

Outside of work I like sports, music, video games, reading, traveling and COFFEE (in no specific order). I'm a huge animal lover and currently have 2 dogs and 2 cats.
